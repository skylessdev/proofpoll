Give me a precise status + next-step recommendation for messaging integrations.

Slack
1) Do we actually require SLACK_CHANNEL_ID anywhere in code? 
   - Grep the repo and list each reference (file:line and purpose).
   - If not required, confirm it can be omitted for /poll + button flows.

2) Current Slack app config expectations:
   - Exact Request URLs we assume (commands + interactions).
   - Minimal scopes we rely on (chat:write only? users:read?).
   - Env vars currently read at runtime (booleans only: present/missing).

3) Dry-run confirmation:
   - Simulate a /poll command payload (no signature) to /api/slack/commands and show 200 response shape.
   - Simulate a button payload (no signature) to /api/slack/interactions and show 200 + async path logs hit.

Discord
4) Interactions endpoint readiness:
   - Is the handler returning `{ "type": 1 }` for PING? Show the exact response now.
   - Confirm Ed25519 verification code path (tweetnacl) is wired to use DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY.
   - List required env vars (booleans only) and whether they’re present.

5) Command registration:
   - Provide the JSON for the `poll` slash command (what we already support).
   - State whether we implemented a guild registration script; if not, note “Portal-only”.

6) End-to-end dry-run:
   - Simulate a TYPE=2 (slash) payload (no signature) → show response shape (buttons + link).
   - Simulate a TYPE=3 (button) payload → show response shape (type 7 update or ephemeral).
   - List any missing pieces to make real prod calls succeed (e.g., Interactions Endpoint URL set, verified over HTTPS).

Cross-cutting
7) What’s currently BLOCKING a real external test for each platform, if anything? (1–3 bullets each with exact fix.)

8) Recommend my NEXT ACTION:
   - If Slack is green: “test live in Slack” with exact steps.
   - If Discord needs setup: “set Interactions URL + register guild command” with the precise portal fields and URLs to paste.
   - Time/complexity estimate for each (S/M/L) and risk notes.

Please include: file paths, minimal diffs if any are needed, and 3–5 log lines proving each dry-run path executed. Do not modify code unless a one-line fix is required to complete the dry-run; if so, show the tiny diff first.
