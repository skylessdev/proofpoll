Now let me create a comprehensive poll analysis page component:Perfect. Here's what I've created for the ProofPoll DBT dashboard:

## Complete DBT Visualization Suite

**1. Main Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**
- **Consensus Health Overview**: Real-time aggregate metrics
- **Vote Analysis Table**: Recent votes with DBT breakdown
- **Voter Integrity Leaderboard**: Top performers by integrity score  
- **Filter by Poll**: Analyze specific polls or system-wide

**2. Live Monitoring (`LiveConsensusMonitor.tsx`)**
- **Real-time Stream**: Live vote feed with divergence indicators
- **Alert System**: Automated warnings for flash swings, high divergence, verdict spikes
- **Health Indicator**: Current consensus strength gauge
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customizable alert rules

**3. Detailed Poll Analysis (`polls/[pollId]/page.tsx`)**
- **Consensus Evolution Chart**: Timeline showing how consensus developed
- **Vote Distribution**: Standard poll results + DBT quality metrics
- **Voter Behavior Analysis**: High integrity vs suspicious voting patterns
- **Forensic Timeline**: Chronological divergence tracking

**4. Supporting API Endpoints**
- `/api/dbt/metrics` - Recent DBT vote metrics
- `/api/dbt/integrity` - Voter integrity scores
- `/api/dbt/consensus` - Consensus evolution data  
- `/api/dbt/stats` - Aggregate system statistics
- `/api/dbt/polls/[id]/analysis` - Detailed poll analysis

## Key Visualizations

**Consensus Health**: Color-coded strength indicator (green = strong consensus, red = high divergence)

**Live Alert System**: Real-time warnings for:
- High divergence spikes (individual votes > 0.8)
- Flash voting patterns (5+ votes/minute)  
- REJECT verdict spikes (>30% rejection rate)

**Evolution Timeline**: Shows how consensus changed over time, with individual vote divergence dots and cumulative average trend line

**Forensic Analysis**: Can trace exactly when and how consensus broke down, which voters contributed to divergence

## Real-World Demo Value

This transforms ProofPoll from a simple voting tool into a **governance analytics platform**. During a Slack demo, you could:

1. Run a controversial poll in the channel
2. Watch the dashboard detect "flash swings" as people rapidly change positions  
3. Show voter integrity scores updating in real-time
4. Analyze which discussion moments led to consensus breakdown

The system provides **measurable evidence** of consensus manipulation, vote brigading, or authentic opinion evolution - making subjective governance decisions quantitatively verifiable.
