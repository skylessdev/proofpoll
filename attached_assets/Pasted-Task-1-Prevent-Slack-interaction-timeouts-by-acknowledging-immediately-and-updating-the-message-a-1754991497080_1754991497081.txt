Task: 
1) Prevent Slack interaction timeouts by acknowledging immediately and updating the message asynchronously via `response_url`.
2) Add a minimal results page at `/app/polls/[id]/page.tsx`.

Guardrails
- Next.js App Router only. No Express/server frameworks.
- No new deps. Use built-in fetch and Node crypto only.
- Keep existing APIs and DB schema unchanged.

Changes

A) app/api/slack/interactions/route.ts
- Keep signature verification and URL-encoded parsing.
- Extract `payload` JSON and read `payload.response_url`.
- Return `new Response('', { status: 200 })` immediately (within 3s).
- After returning (use `queueMicrotask` or `setTimeout(0)`), do:
  - POST `/api/polls/{pollId}/vote` with `{ optionId, source:'slack', userId }`.
  - On 409: POST to `response_url` with `{ response_type:'ephemeral', text:'You already voted in this poll.' }`.
  - On success: GET `/api/polls/{pollId}`, build updated blocks with tallies, then POST to `response_url`:
      {
        "replace_original": true,
        "blocks": [ ...updated blocks with counts... ]
      }
- Do NOT wait for these async fetches before returning the 200.

B) app/polls/[id]/page.tsx
- Server component that fetches the poll JSON and renders results.
- Use request headers to build the absolute base URL (no APP_BASE_URL required):
    import { headers } from 'next/headers';
    const h = headers();
    const proto = h.get('x-forwarded-proto') ?? 'https';
    const host = h.get('x-forwarded-host') ?? h.get('host');
    const base = `${proto}://${host}`;
- GET `${base}/api/polls/${params.id}` with `{ cache: 'no-store' }`.
- Render:
  - Title (poll.question)
  - List of options with counts and a simple % bar (Tailwind ok)
  - “Last updated just now” note; no auto-refresh required.

Acceptance Criteria
- Clicking a Slack vote button no longer shows the “Operation timed out” toast.
- The original Slack message updates with tallies within ~1–2s (via response_url).
- Duplicate vote shows an ephemeral “You already voted…” message.
- Visiting `/polls/<id>` shows the poll with correct counts (no 404).
- No new dependencies added.

- The new file `app/polls/[id]/page.tsx`
- A short snippet of the POST you send to `response_url`.
