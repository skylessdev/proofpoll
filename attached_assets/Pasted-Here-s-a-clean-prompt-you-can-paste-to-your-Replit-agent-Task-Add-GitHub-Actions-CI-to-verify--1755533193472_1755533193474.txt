Task: Add GitHub Actions CI to verify SPDX headers and build the app

Goal
	•	Create a single workflow .github/workflows/ci.yml that:
	1.	Verifies SPDX headers via node scripts/verify-headers.mjs
	2.	Builds the Next.js project to ensure it compiles

Guardrails
	•	Do not modify application code or env usage.
	•	Do not add dependencies.
	•	Use Node.js 20.
	•	CI must not require secrets; skip Slack/Discord calls.
	•	Keep the existing license-check.yml if present, but prefer the new ci.yml as the primary workflow.

Implementation Steps
	1.	Add .github/workflows/ci.yml with this content:

name: License & Build

on:
  push:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  verify-and-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED: 1
      NODE_ENV: production
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          if [ -f package-lock.json ]; then
            npm ci
          else
            npm install
          fi

      - name: Verify SPDX headers
        run: node scripts/verify-headers.mjs

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

	2.	Ensure the project has a build script in package.json (should already exist via Next.js). If missing, add:

"scripts": {
  "build": "next build"
}

(If package.json is read-only via agent, report back; do not force-edit.)
	3.	Keep existing workflow(s) intact, but mention in the PR description that ci.yml supersedes them for full checks.

Acceptance Criteria
	•	.github/workflows/ci.yml exists with the exact content above.
	•	npm run build completes in CI without requiring secrets.
	•	node scripts/verify-headers.mjs runs and passes in CI.
	•	Provide:
	•	File tree snippet showing .github/workflows/ci.yml
	•	git diff --stat summary
	•	A link/instructions to view the workflow run in GitHub Actions

Before changing files
	•	Show a short plan (≤5 bullets) and WAIT for my OK.
