Beautiful‚ÄîSPDX headers are in and the app still runs. üéØ
Two quick things to finish the licensing story and button it up for GitHub:

Must-do checklist
	1.	Add the actual license files at repo root:
	‚Ä¢	LICENSE-MIT (MIT text)
	‚Ä¢	LICENSE-MPL-2.0 (full, verbatim MPL 2.0 text)
	2.	Commit & push (so GitHub detects the license).
	3.	(Optional) add a verify script to CI that ensures every source file has the SPDX line.

Paste this to your Replit agent

Task: Finalize dual licensing

Goal
- Add root-level license files and a quick SPDX header verifier.
- Do not change app code.

Steps
1) Create LICENSE-MIT with the canonical MIT text:

MIT License

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
THE SOFTWARE.

2) Create LICENSE-MPL-2.0 with the full, unmodified MPL 2.0 text (verbatim, from the official source). Do not truncate or alter; include ‚ÄúExhibit A‚Äù.

3) Add a tiny verifier script scripts/verify-headers.mjs that exits non-zero if any targeted source file is missing the line:
   SPDX-License-Identifier: (MIT OR MPL-2.0)
   - Target globs: app/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,css}, lib/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}, utils/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}, prisma/**/*.prisma, **/*.sql
   - Skip: node_modules, .next, .vercel, build, dist, coverage, prisma/migrations/**
   - Respect ‚Äòuse client/server‚Äô, shebangs, etc. (read-only check)

4) Add npm scripts:
   "license:verify": "node scripts/verify-headers.mjs"

5) Run the verifier and show:
   - file count checked
   - any offenders (should be none)
   - git diff --stat
   - confirm LICENSE files present

Acceptance Criteria
- LICENSE-MIT and LICENSE-MPL-2.0 exist at repo root with correct contents.
- license:verify passes.
- README already mentions dual license and links work.
- Provide file tree + diff summary.

Then push to GitHub

git add .
git commit -m "docs: add MIT & MPL-2.0 licenses + SPDX verifier"
git push

If you want, I can also give you a one-file GitHub Action that runs npm ci && npm run license:verify && npm run build on PRs to keep headers and builds green.
